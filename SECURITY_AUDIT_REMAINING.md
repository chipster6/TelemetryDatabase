# Security Audit - Remaining Vulnerabilities

## Status: 22 of 27 Security Vulnerabilities Still Need Implementation

### Critical Authentication & Authorization Issues (5 remaining)
- [ ] **Missing authentication timeouts** - Sessions never expire, allowing indefinite access
- [ ] **No multi-factor authentication** - Single factor authentication insufficient for biometric data
- [ ] **Insufficient password complexity requirements** - Current validation too weak
- [ ] **Missing account lockout mechanisms** - No protection against brute force attacks
- [ ] **Inadequate authorization checks** - Biometric data access needs stricter controls

### Input Validation & Injection Prevention (6 remaining)
- [ ] **SQL injection vulnerabilities** - Database queries not properly parameterized
- [ ] **XSS vulnerabilities** - User inputs not sanitized for cross-site scripting
- [ ] **Command injection risks** - File operations vulnerable to command injection
- [ ] **Path traversal vulnerabilities** - File access not restricted to safe directories
- [ ] **NoSQL injection** - Vector database operations lack input validation
- [ ] **Prototype pollution** - Object handling vulnerable to prototype manipulation

### Encryption & Data Protection (4 remaining)
- [ ] **Weak encryption key management** - Keys not properly rotated or secured
- [ ] **Missing data masking** - Sensitive information exposed in logs/responses
- [ ] **Inadequate secure deletion** - Sensitive data not properly wiped
- [ ] **Lack of field-level encryption** - PII stored without granular encryption

### Network Security (4 remaining)
- [ ] **Missing rate limiting** - API endpoints vulnerable to DoS attacks
- [ ] **Insufficient CSRF protection** - Cross-site request forgery not prevented
- [ ] **Lack of request size limits** - No protection against large payload DoS
- [ ] **Missing security headers** - HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options not implemented

### Error Handling & Information Disclosure (3 remaining)
- [ ] **Verbose error messages** - System information leaked in error responses
- [ ] **Stack traces leaked** - Debug information exposed to clients
- [ ] **Debug information in production** - Development data visible in production

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Must Fix)
1. SQL injection prevention
2. Rate limiting implementation
3. Authentication timeout mechanisms
4. Security headers implementation
5. XSS prevention measures

### Medium Priority (Should Fix)
6. Multi-factor authentication
7. Account lockout mechanisms
8. CSRF protection enhancement
9. Error handling security
10. Data masking implementation

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)
11. Advanced encryption key management
12. Secure deletion mechanisms
13. Command injection prevention
14. Path traversal protection
15. NoSQL injection prevention

## Estimated Implementation Time
- **High Priority fixes:** 2-3 days
- **Medium Priority fixes:** 2-3 days  
- **Lower Priority fixes:** 1-2 days
- **Total estimated time:** 5-8 days for complete security implementation

## Risk Assessment
**Current Risk Level: HIGH** - Multiple critical vulnerabilities remain unaddressed, particularly around injection attacks and authentication security.

## Notes
- This audit identified 27+ total vulnerabilities
- Only 5 have been implemented (hardcoded credentials, basic validation, post-quantum encryption setup)
- Biometric data requires maximum security - all vulnerabilities should be addressed
- Post-quantum encryption is implemented but other attack vectors remain open
