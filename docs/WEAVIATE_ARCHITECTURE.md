# Weaviate-First Architecture Guide

## Overview

The Nexis AI Biometric Platform operates on a **Weaviate-first architecture** where Weaviate Cloud serves as the primary intelligent storage system, while PostgreSQL handles only authentication. This design enables infinite memory, sophisticated AI responses, and advanced pattern learning from biometric data.

## Why Weaviate Over PostgreSQL?

### Traditional Limitations
- **Fixed Context Windows**: Limited conversation history
- **No Semantic Understanding**: SQL queries can't understand meaning
- **Manual Indexing**: Requires complex full-text search setup
- **Isolated Data**: Difficult to find patterns across conversations

### Weaviate Advantages
- **Infinite Memory**: Store unlimited conversation history with instant retrieval
- **Semantic Search**: Find conversations by meaning, not just keywords
- **Automatic Vectorization**: AI-powered content embedding and indexing
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from biometric correlations automatically
- **RAG-Ready**: Built for Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines

## Architecture Components

### Primary Storage: Weaviate Cloud

#### NexisConversation Class
Stores complete conversation history with rich biometric context:

```typescript
interface NexisConversation {
  // Core conversation
  conversationId: string;
  userId: number;
  userMessage: string;
  aiResponse: string;
  conversationType: string;
  effectivenessScore: number;
  
  // Biometric snapshot
  heartRate: number;
  hrv: number;
  stressLevel: number;
  attentionLevel: number;
  cognitiveLoad: number;
  flowState: number;
  
  // Neurodivergent markers
  hyperfocusState: boolean;
  contextSwitches: number;
  sensoryLoad: number;
  executiveFunction: number;
  
  // Environmental context
  timeOfDay: string;
  location: string;
  soundLevel: number;
  lightLevel: number;
  temperature: number;
  
  // Learning markers
  isBreakthrough: boolean;
  difficultyLevel: number;
  userSatisfaction: number;
  adaptationNeeded: boolean;
}
```

#### NexisMemoryNode Class
Personal memories and learned patterns:

```typescript
interface NexisMemoryNode {
  memoryId: string;
  userId: number;
  content: string;
  memoryType: 'preference' | 'fact' | 'pattern' | 'skill';
  importance: number;
  confidenceLevel: number;
  emotionalValence: number;
  relatedTopics: string[];
  retrievalStrength: number;
}
```

#### NexisBiometricPattern Class
Learned correlations between biometric states and response effectiveness:

```typescript
interface NexisBiometricPattern {
  patternId: string;
  userId: number;
  biometricSignature: BiometricRange;
  optimalStrategies: string[];
  effectiveness: number;
  sampleSize: number;
  confidenceLevel: number;
}
```

### Secondary Storage: PostgreSQL

Only handles authentication and basic user management:

```sql
-- Minimal PostgreSQL schema
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id VARCHAR(128) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  data TEXT
);
```

## RAG Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Context Retrieval
When user asks a question:

```typescript
// Find relevant past conversations
const similarConversations = await weaviate
  .get()
  .withClassName('NexisConversation')
  .withNearText({ concepts: [userQuery] })
  .withLimit(10)
  .do();

// Find conversations from similar biometric states
const biometricMatches = await weaviate
  .get()
  .withClassName('NexisConversation')
  .withWhere({
    operator: 'And',
    operands: [
      { path: ['cognitiveLoad'], operator: 'GreaterThan', valueNumber: currentBiometrics.cognitiveLoad - 0.1 },
      { path: ['cognitiveLoad'], operator: 'LessThan', valueNumber: currentBiometrics.cognitiveLoad + 0.1 }
    ]
  })
  .do();
```

### 2. Pattern Learning
System continuously learns optimal response strategies:

```typescript
// Learn from effectiveness patterns
const patterns = await weaviate
  .get()
  .withClassName('NexisBiometricPattern')
  .withWhere({
    path: ['userId'],
    operator: 'Equal',
    valueInt: userId
  })
  .do();
```

### 3. Response Generation
Build comprehensive context for AI response:

```typescript
const context = {
  userQuery,
  currentBiometrics,
  relevantConversations: similarConversations,
  biometricPatterns: patterns,
  personalMemories: memories,
  environmentalFactors: currentEnvironment
};

const response = await generateBiometricAwareResponse(context);
```

## Biometric-Enhanced AI Responses

### Cognitive State Adaptation

The system adapts responses based on current cognitive state:

#### High Cognitive Load
- **Strategy**: Simplified, step-by-step responses
- **Tone**: Supportive and clear
- **Length**: Shorter, focused content
- **Examples**: More concrete, fewer abstractions

#### Flow State
- **Strategy**: Maintain momentum with direct answers
- **Tone**: Efficient and focused
- **Length**: Complete but concise
- **Examples**: Advanced techniques and optimizations

#### High Stress
- **Strategy**: Calming, solution-focused responses
- **Tone**: Reassuring and supportive
- **Length**: Structured with clear next steps
- **Examples**: Practical, immediately actionable advice

#### Hyperfocus (Neurodivergent)
- **Strategy**: Deep, detailed information
- **Tone**: Technical and comprehensive
- **Length**: Extended with rich detail
- **Examples**: Multiple approaches and edge cases

### Pattern Learning Examples

The system learns correlations like:

```typescript
// Example learned patterns
{
  "pattern": "High stress + debugging questions",
  "optimalStrategy": "structured_debugging",
  "effectiveness": 0.89,
  "adaptations": [
    "Break problems into smaller steps",
    "Provide calming reassurance",
    "Include stress-reduction tips",
    "Focus on systematic approaches"
  ]
}

{
  "pattern": "Flow state + creative tasks",
  "optimalStrategy": "creative_expansion",
  "effectiveness": 0.94,
  "adaptations": [
    "Provide multiple creative alternatives",
    "Encourage experimental approaches",
    "Minimal interruption to flow",
    "Advanced technique suggestions"
  ]
}
```

## Custom LLM Training Pipeline

### Data Export for Training

The system exports high-quality conversations for custom LLM training:

```typescript
interface TrainingDataPoint {
  instruction: string;     // Biometric-aware system prompt
  input: string;          // User query
  output: string;         // Optimized AI response
  biometric_context: {
    heartRate: number;
    cognitiveLoad: number;
    stressLevel: number;
    flowState: number;
  };
  effectiveness: number;   // Response effectiveness score
  cognitive_state: string; // "high_flow" | "high_stress" | "balanced"
}
```

### Training Data Grouping

Data is grouped by cognitive states for specialized training:

- **high_flow_state.jsonl** - Responses optimized for flow state
- **high_stress.jsonl** - Calming, structured responses
- **high_cognitive_load.jsonl** - Simplified, clear responses
- **hyperfocus.jsonl** - Deep, detailed responses for neurodivergent users
- **balanced.jsonl** - General-purpose responses

### Custom Model Benefits

A trained custom model would:

1. **Inherently understand biometric context** without explicit prompting
2. **Automatically adapt response style** based on cognitive state
3. **Remember user patterns** and preferences at the model level
4. **Provide neurodivergent-optimized responses** by default
5. **Maintain consistency** across all platform interactions

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
// Context caching for performance
const contextCache = new Map();

// Cache frequent patterns
const userPatterns = await getUserPatterns(userId);
contextCache.set(`patterns_${userId}`, userPatterns);

// Cache recent conversations
const recentConversations = await getRecentConversations(userId, 50);
contextCache.set(`recent_${userId}`, recentConversations);
```

### Batch Processing

```typescript
// Batch similar queries for efficiency
const batchQueries = [];
batchQueries.push(similarConversationsQuery);
batchQueries.push(biometricPatternsQuery);
batchQueries.push(personalMemoriesQuery);

const results = await weaviate.batch().add(batchQueries);
```

### Rate Limiting

```typescript
// Intelligent rate limiting based on query complexity
const complexityScore = calculateQueryComplexity(query);
const rateLimit = complexityScore > 0.8 ? 10 : 50; // requests per minute
```

## Monitoring and Health

### Key Metrics

- **Query Response Time**: Average time for semantic searches
- **Context Relevance**: How well retrieved context matches queries
- **Pattern Learning Rate**: How quickly new patterns are identified
- **Effectiveness Improvement**: Response quality over time
- **Storage Efficiency**: Data compression and retrieval speed

### Health Checks

```typescript
// Comprehensive health monitoring
const healthCheck = {
  weaviateConnection: await checkWeaviateHealth(),
  schemaIntegrity: await validateSchema(),
  vectorIndexHealth: await checkVectorIndices(),
  dataQuality: await assessDataQuality(),
  performanceMetrics: await getPerformanceStats()
};
```

## Migration Benefits

### Before: PostgreSQL-Centric
- Limited conversation history (performance degrades)
